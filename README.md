# DLS-Super-Resolution

Constraints: implement super resolution from 64x64 RGB image to 256x256 RGB image, utilizing perceptual loss, GAN loss, IMLE loss, or nomalizing flow loss.

To train models, use the IPYNB files in colab. To test, place the models.py and __init__.py fiels (edited for proper architecture and model loading, if necessary) in the provided grader.
